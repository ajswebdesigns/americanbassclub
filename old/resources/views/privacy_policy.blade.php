the Light” law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California 
customers asking about the businesses’ practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the 
third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose 
personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes if the customer 
has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing. As discussed above, if you wish to find out more 
about your opt-out rights or opt out of our sharing of your information with third parties for the third parties’ 
direct marketing purposes offline, please contact us at inf@americanbassclub.com. To opt out of our sharing your 
information with third parties for use with their direct marketing purposes via email, please click here. California 
Consumer Privacy Act, The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides California residents with rights to 
receive certain disclosures regarding the collection, use, and sharing of information about them, as well as rights to 
know/access, delete, and limit sharing of personal information. You have the right to be free from discrimination 
based on your exercise of your CCPA rights. To the extent that we collect Personal Information that is subject to the 
CCPA, that information, our practices, and your rights are described below. Notice at Collection Regarding the 
Categories of Personal Information Collected You have the right to receive notice of the categories of Personal 
Information we collect, and the purposes for which we use Personal Information. The categories we use below to 
describe Personal Information are those enumerated in the CCPA. We collect this Personal Information for the 
purposes described in the How We Use the Information section above. • Personal Identifiers: We collect identifying 
information such as your name, phone number, email address and contact address. We may also collect 
information from you about other people, such as if you provide us with contact information to purchase a gift 
card. We collect your social media handle and basic account information when you interact with us through social 
media. We collect a unique numerical identifier, assigned to you by a first-party cookie, automatically when you use

preferences based on the information we and our partners gather when you interact with our website. Our 
practices regarding the disclosure and sale of your Personal Information are described below. To opt-out of the sale 
of your Personal Information, please visit our “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” page here. Right to Know 
About Sources of Personal Information and Personal Information Disclosed or Sold During the preceding 12 
months, we have disclosed for business purposes and/or sold the following categories of personal information to 
the following categories of recipients: Category to which we sell personal information categories of entities to 
which We Disclose Personal Information Personal Identifiers; third party agents selling magazines on our behalf; 
sponsors who enroll you into a membership with us; our social media pages we may sell contact details that we 
obtain from you when you register for a membership or our other products to list brokers Any type of service 
provider listed above Commercial Information You N/A Any type of service provider listed above Internet or Other 
Electronic Network Activity Information You Analytics and advertising partners Any type of service provider listed 
above Geolocation You Analytics and advertising partners Any type of service provider listed above Inferences 
drawn to create a profile about a consumer reflecting the consumer’s preferences or characteristics You N/A Any 
type of service provider listed above Entities to whom we disclose information for business purposes are service 
providers, which are companies that we engage to conduct activities on our behalf. Service providers are restricted 
from using Personal Information for any purpose that is not related to our engagement. Entities to whom we “sell” 
information are third parties. Under the CCPA, a business “sells” personal information when it discloses it to a 
company for monetary or other benefit. A company may be considered a third party either because the purpose 
for its sharing of personal information is not for an enumerated business purpose under California law, or because 
its contract does not restrict it from using personal Information for other purposes. Right to Opt Out of Sale of 
Personal Information to Third Parties You have the right to opt out of any sale of your Personal Information by ABC 
to third parties. To exercise your right to opt out of the sale of your Personal Information, please visit our “Do Not 
Sell My Personal Information” webpage. Please note that your right to opt out does not apply to our sharing of 
Personal Information with service providers. We may also disclose information to other entities who are not listed 
here when required by law or to protect our Company or other persons, as described in this Privacy Policy. Right to 
Know and Request Access to and Deletion of Personal Information You have the right to request access to Personal 
Information collected about you and information regarding the source of that Personal Information, the purposes 
for which we collect it, and the third parties and service providers with whom we share it. You also have the right 
to request in certain circumstances that we delete Personal Information that we have collected directly from you. 
We may have a reason under the law why we do not have to comply with your request, or why we may comply 
with it in a more limited way than you anticipated. If we do, we will explain that to you in our response. How to 
Submit an Access or Deletion Request You may submit a request to exercise your rights to know/access or delete 
your personal information by contacting us at info@americanbassclub.com. You may authorize another individual 
or a business registered with the California Secretary of State, called an authorized agent, to make requests on your 
behalf through these means. Verification Procedures In order to process your request to know/access or delete 
Personal Information we collect, disclose, or sell, we must verify your request. We verify your identity by asking you 
to provide personal identifiers we can match against information we may have collected from you previously and 
confirm your request using the email or telephone account stated in the request. We will not use Personal 
Information we collect in connection with verifying or responding to your request for any purpose other than 
responding to your request. Notice Regarding Participation in Financial Incentives We may run promotions, loyalty 
programs, sweepstakes, Fantasy Fishing, and contests (our “Incentives”) from time to time whereby we incentivize 
a customer to provide personal identifiers. We will provide you with more information about these incentives when 
you sign up, and participation is voluntary. You may opt out of participating in Incentives at any time or exercise 
your right of deletion, but if you do, you may no longer be able to receive the benefit of the Incentive because we 
may require your Personal Information to administer the Incentive (such as to send you money or products if you 
win a sweepstakes). Special Information for Job Applicants When you apply for a job with ABC, we collect certain 
information about you as outlined in this Policy. Information may be collected about you in multiple ways: you may 
provide it to us in connection with your application; we may make observations in the application process or collect 
information from public information sources; or you may authorize us to collect information from other sources, 
such as a former employer or reference. In certain circumstances, you may submit your application for employment 
through a third-party service that displays our job posting. We do not control the privacy practices of these third-
party services. Please review their privacy policies carefully prior to submitting your application materials. Special 
Information for Nevada Residents of the State of Nevada have the right to opt out of the sale of certain pieces of 
their information to other companies who will sell or license their information to others. If you are a Nevada 
resident and would like to make such a request or want more information about our data sharing practices, please 
contact us at info@americanbassclub.com. Changes to This Policy We may make changes to this Policy from time to 
time. The “Effective Date” at the top of this page indicates when this Privacy Policy was last revised. We may also 
notify you in other ways from time to time about the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information 
described in this Policy. For questions about our privacy practices, please contact us at
