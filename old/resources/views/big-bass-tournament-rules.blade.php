        <p>We started these no entry fee Big bass tournaments to offer a way for members to practice using their
          ConnectScale,
          however, they also tend to have some bragging rights associated with them. The rules are simple, catch a Big
          Largemouth
          or Smallmouth and take a Photo with the fish on a bump board. Put the fish on the ConnectScale and weigh it.
          Register it
          in the respective Big bass tournament. Please make sure you add the photos and have the correct tournament
          code, for
          Largemouth (LM2022), for Smallmouth (SM2022). At the end of the 2022 season we will announce the winner for
          each. We will
          also award some prizes provided by our sponsors for each tournament. Good luck and have fun, but most of all
          learn how
          to use your ConnectScale!</p>
